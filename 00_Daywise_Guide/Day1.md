    A[Trade Executed] --> B[Trade Confirmation]
    B --> C[Clearing Corporation]
    C --> D[Payment/Delivery T+1]
    D --> E[Shares in Demat]
```

### **Key Components**

## üõ°Ô∏è **Section 3: Circuit Breakers & Market Psychology (30 minutes)**

### **Individual Stock Circuit Breakers**
- **5% circuit**: Applied to most stocks
- **10% circuit**: Applied to select liquid stocks
- **20% circuit**: Applied to highly liquid stocks (Nifty 50 mostly)
- **No circuit**: Derivatives, special categories

### **Index Circuit Breakers**
```yaml
Level 1 (10% drop): 15-minute halt
Level 2 (15% drop): 15-minute halt  
Level 3 (20% drop): Trading halted for the day
```

### **Market-wide Circuit Breakers (2008 implementation)**
- **Triggered by**: Nifty 50 or Sensex movement
- **Timing matters**: Different halt durations based on time of day
- **Cooling period**: Allows emotions to settle

### **üß† Psychology & Trading Implications**
```yaml
Panic Prevention:
  - Prevents flash crashes
  - Gives time for rational decision-making
  - Reduces algorithmic trading impact

Strategic Opportunities:
  - Circuit-to-circuit moves indicate strong momentum
  - Opening after halt often shows true sentiment
  - Volume spikes near circuit levels

Risk Management:
  - Stop losses may not execute at exact levels
  - Gap openings after circuit halts
  - Liquidity issues near circuit limits
```

## üìä **Section 4: Order Book Dynamics (30 minutes)**

### **Order Book Components**
```
Bid Side (Buyers)          |  Ask Side (Sellers)
Quantity | Price | Orders  |  Orders | Price | Quantity
   500   | 100.0 |   25    |    15   | 100.5 |   300
  1200   |  99.5 |   40    |    20   | 101.0 |   800
  2000   |  99.0 |   65    |    35   | 101.5 |  1500
```

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- **Bid-Ask Spread**: Difference between best bid and ask
- **Market Depth**: Total quantity at each price level
- **Last Traded Price (LTP)**: Most recent execution price
- **Order Imbalance**: Bid vs ask quantity ratio

### **üí° Microstructure Insights**
```yaml
Liquidity Assessment:
  - Tight spreads = high liquidity
  - Deep order book = stable prices
  - Wide spreads = be cautious with market orders

Entry/Exit Timing:
  - Large bid stacks = potential support
  - Large ask stacks = potential resistance
  - Order flow changes = momentum shifts

Slippage Prediction:
  - Calculate average depth for your order size
  - Monitor spread widening during volatility
  - Use limit orders for better fills
