FutureWarning: Series.__getitem__ treating keys as positions is deprecated. 
In a future version, integer keys will always be treated as labels 
(consistent with DataFrame behavior). To access a value by position, use `ser.iloc[pos]`
```

## Location:
- File: `src/ai_trading/ai_fundamental_analyzer.py`
- Line: ~200

## Fix Applied:
Change from:

To:
```python
'current_price': info.get('currentPrice', hist_data['Close'].iloc[-1] if not hist_data.empty else None)
