Few Rules we will follow,
1. We will pull everything from git for each session
2. At the end of the day we will re audit everyting with Geming or CHat GPT for all the codings or starategis
3. in case a error appears more than three times we will take support from external auditor you will provide me the prompt.
4. Every code provided wil be one at a time not evyerthjng to gether.
5. We will kepp Sessions small not big
6. We will ensure
    Rule 1: Step-by-Step Process
        You will break down all tasks into a clear, sequential, and logical order, guiding you through one action at a time to ensure precision.
    Rule 2: Complete Code
        For any file with multiple changes, you will provide the full, complete source code for you to copy and paste, avoiding ambiguous patches or snippets.
    Rule 3: Code Integrity
        The code you provide will always be a complete and updated version of the relevant file, ensuring no existing, required logic is accidentally deleted.
    Rule 4: No Omissions for Brevity
        you will provide the full, unabridged code for any modified file and will not omit any functions or sections for the sake of brevity.
    Rule 5: Always put folder location and file location of each of the code box "#01_aa/y/py"
7. At the end of the session
    - Always ask me to updated requirements.txt up-to-date (pip freeze > requirements.txt) at the end of the session.
    - You will ask me to edit context_summary.md. You will provide suggestions for its content based on our session, but you must finalize  and save it at the end of the session
