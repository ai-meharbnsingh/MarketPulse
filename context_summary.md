### Current Challenges/Blockers:

**None Currently** - Foundation phase is complete and ready for development start.

**Potential Upcoming Challenges**:
- AI API cost management across multiple providers
- Real-time data integration complexity
- Multi-timeframe model coordination
- Personal finance integration with trading algorithms

### Next Major Steps:

**Immediate (Tomorrow - Day 1)**:
1. Complete Git repository setup and initial push
2. Begin Foundation Week with Indian market structure study
3. Configure Antifragile Framework with actual API keys
4. Test basic AI connectivity across all providers

**This Week (Foundation Week)**:
- Day 1: Market structure + project setup
- Day 2: Trading psychology + AI framework configuration  
- Day 3: Multi-timeframe analysis + AI pattern recognition
- Day 4: Portfolio theory + AI optimization
- Day 5: Technical analysis + AI signal generation
- Day 6: Fundamental analysis + AI document processing
- Day 7: System architecture review + integration testing

**Next 2 Weeks (Phase 1)**:
- Real-time market data collection with AI processing
- News and sentiment data pipeline with multi-AI analysis
- Database setup and data quality framework
- Advanced feature engineering for Indian market specifics

### Technical Priorities:

1. **Git Workflow Establishment**: Proper version control with daily commits
2. **AI Framework Testing**: Verify multi-provider failover functionality
3. **Data Pipeline Creation**: Real-time market data with AI enhancement
